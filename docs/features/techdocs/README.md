## Project roadmap

### Now

No current plans.

### Next

No current plans.

### Someday/Maybe

* TODO:
- What can we do in TechDocs to help drive up documentation quality? We have many ideas, for example, a Trust Card with associated Trust Score and automatic triggering of documentation maintenance notifications.
- Contribute to and deploy from a marketplace of TechDocs Addons
- Addon: MDX (allows you to use JSX in your Markdown content)
- Can we go static site generator agnostic?
- Better integration with
  [Scaffolder V2](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/2771) (e.g. easy to choose and apply documentation template with Software Templates)
- Possible to configure several aspects about TechDocs (e.g. URL, homepage,
  theme)
